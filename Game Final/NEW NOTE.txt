Notes for Tower Stuff: 

- Essentially the list should be looped within the move method each time so each tower checks if there's a balloon nearby shoots
appropriately
- We also have to add in animation for the shooting
- Each tower's move should probably call shootcheck to see if it should shoot. 
- TowerTrial is irrelevant now
